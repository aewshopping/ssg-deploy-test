# Popular history books

This repository holds the source code for the website [popularhistorybooks.com](https://popularhistorybooks.com).

It is powered by [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), a lightweight static site generator. Blurb: _all the power of a server-side framework but it builds plain HTML files for fast loading by your visitors._

More information on how the site is put together can be found on the website itself, in the tech acknowledgements page (link in the page footer).

## What's the website all about?

This website is a blog for reading and reviewing popular history books. We review great (hopefully!) new (probably...) history (certainly ðŸ™‚) books. Also with occasional opinion pieces on the study of history.

## Born on Glitch âœ¨

[Glitch](https://glitch.com) was a friendly community where millions of people come together to build web apps and websites. Unfortunately it will  close down in July 2025.

This project started with the official Eleventy template on Glitch: [Minimal Eleventy](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/11ty) I suspect this link will stop working soon...
