# Popular history books

This repository holds the source code for the website [popularhistorybooks.com](popularhistorybooks.com).

It is powered by [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), a lightweight static site generator. Blurb: _all the power of a server-side framework but it builds plain HTML files for fast loading by your visitors._

More information on how the site is put together can be found on the website itself, in the tech acknowledgements page (link in the page footer).

## What's the website all about?

This website is a blog for reading and reviewing popular history books. We review great (hopefully!) new (probably...) history (certainly ðŸ™‚) books. Also with occasional opinion pieces on the study of history.

## Built with Glitch! âœ¨

[Glitch](https://glitch.com) is a friendly community where millions of people come together to build web apps and websites.

This project started with the official Eleventy template on Glitch: [Minimal Eleventy](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/11ty)!
