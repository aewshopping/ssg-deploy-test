# About us

We read history books for fun!

With no affiliation to any publishers, booksellers, authors, librarians, bookbinders, or papermakers we can write independent reviews.

Our mission is to find and review history books that might otherwise get overlooked - hence Emperor Justinian's beady eye peering out at the top of the website ðŸ¤¨.
