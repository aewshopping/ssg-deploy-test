- The purpose of this list is to give you a good feel for all the history books published recently in hardback in the UK, ordered by publication date with the newest at the top. When you first load the page it will show the first {{ max_intial_books }} most recently published books, but you can see many more less recent books if you use the filter. It is a reasonably exhaustive list but‚Ä¶
  - I have excluded military history books which I see as a category all on its own (and would if included have swamped the non-military history books).
  - I have excluded history books that I see as too ‚Äúlocal‚Äù eg the many books on particular aspects of the US Civil War, or the many books focussing on relatives of medieval English kings.
- The filter is an AND filter. For example if you select '{% twemoji "üóìÔ∏è" %} 2021' and '{% twemoji "üëë" %} Political' then only books that have both attributes will be shown - 2021 AND Political. I think this is most useful because it allows you to narrow down your search to smaller and smaller subsets.
- This history book database is hand-curated - the categories for the books are chosen by me when I do my monthly roundup. This means they can't be manipulated to boost sales (‚Äúhey my book is in *all* the categories...‚Äù) but also that you may or may not agree with my judgement üôÇ.
- Links are provided to Amazon UK and US for convenience only, with no affiliation on my part. Please ignore them if you want to shop elsewhere.
- Finally for the more technicially minded among you: this book filter is the front end of a Datasette read-only SQLite database using the API that is generated automatically when you pass SQL queries through a Datasette URL.</div>
