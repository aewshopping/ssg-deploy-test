This site __does not__ store your personal information.

It will record your preference for colour mode in your browser's local storage, together with your preference for article text size. This will get "remembered" by your own computer if you navigate from page to page or visit again. This information stays with you.

I also use some external services who will have their own privacy policies:

### Cloudinary

Images are served from [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com). Their dashboard reporting tool is designed to show me how much bandwidth I am using up by providing images on this website, and can therefore can also provide simple aggregated and anonymous information on how many new visitors there are to the site, which countries they are from and whether they are using a mobile or a desktop.

This is currently my only way of keeping rough track of the number of users on this site.

### Google fonts

Fonts are loaded from [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). Google will track font usage numbers, their [font FAQ](https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq) has more details.
