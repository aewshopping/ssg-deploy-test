Here are they are - the latest history books available to buy.

A definite European bias this month with medieval and early modern periods featuring strongly...

My personal highlights:

- I like the look of __The Lion House: The Coming of A King__, about Suleyman the Magnificent the Ottoman Sultan, and will be adding that to my list.
- Also: __The Restless Republic: Britain without a Crown__ covering ordinary and celebrity lives during Britain's 10 years without a king from 1649.
- I will also mention __Legacy of Violence: A History of the British Empire__ which I think is an important book to be aware of... and it gets a front cover plug from my old history tutor too.

Hover over the book and click the little flags for links to Amazon UK and US book pages.
