The April 2022 new history books round up!

A bit of a range on offer, from ancient to very modern and a decent geographical spread.

I'm going to try to find the time to read:

- __Mutinous Women: How French Convicts Became Founding Mothers of the Gulf Coast__, whose title says it all really. It sounds like a fascinating and in parts very harrowing story.
- Also __Persians: The Age of The Great Kings__ written from the Persian's point of view by a history professor who presumably knows his stuff.
- And finally __The Empress and the English Doctor: How Catherine the Great defied a deadly virus__ which looks like an intriguing tale even it has clearly commandeered the COVID bandwagon.

Hover over the book and click the little flags for links to Amazon UK and US book pages.
