The April 2022 new history books round up!

A bit of a range on offer, from ancient to very modern and a decent geographical spread.

I'm going to try to find the time to read:

- __Mutinous Women: How French Convicts Became Founding Mothers of the Gulf Coast__, whose title says it all really. It sounds like a fascinating and in parts very harrowing story.
- Also __Persians: The Age of The Great Kings__ written from the Persian's point of view by a history professor who presumably knows his stuff.
- And finally __The Empress and the English Doctor: How Catherine the Great defied a deadly virus__ which looks like an intriguing tale even it has clearly commandeered the COVID bandwagon.
