What do we have to delve into this month?

- A couple on ancient Egypt, including one __A Year in the Life of Ancient Egypt__ (from the same author who wrote _24 Hours in Ancient Egypt_) which looks like an entertaining read.
- __African Founders: How Enslaved People Expanded American Ideals__ which explores how people from Africa influenced (north) American thought and identity.
- I like the look of __Nomads: The Wanderers Who Shaped Our World__ because even if they didn't write so good you should never write them off.
- And the hopefully majestic __In the Shadow of the Gods: The Emperor in World History__.

So I will stick them on the virtual to be read pile and see how I get on!
