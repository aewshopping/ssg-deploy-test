What's new this month? We've got 14 history books on our 'just published' list, four of which have picqued my interest...

- __A History of Delusions: The Glass King,
  a Substitute Husband and a Walking Corpse__ which examines the changing nature of delusions to shine a light on wider society.
- __The Zambezi: A History__ - I hope this is a good read, because we have so few history books published on sub-saharan Africa in the UK.
- __The Making of the Modern Philippines:
  Pieces of a Jigsaw State__ covering a country which is often in the news these days but of which I know very little.
- and finally __Vagabonds: Life on the Streets of
  Nineteenth-century London__ in which I hope to find out how accurate or inaccurate Dickens was!
