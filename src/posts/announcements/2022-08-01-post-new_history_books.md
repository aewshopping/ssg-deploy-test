Not so many new history books this month, but no doubt the quality is still up there!

A few which have piqued my interest are:

- __Two Houses Two Kingdoms: A History of France and England, 1100–1300__ which follows the royals of that time and the importance of their personal relations on war and peace.
- __The Samurai and the Cross: The Jesuit Enterprise in Early Modern Japan__ looking at an under-reported aspect of Japanese / European relations (athough there seem to be some supply issues with getting hold of a paper copy of this book at the moment).
- __Femina: A New History of the Middle Ages, Through the Women Written Out of It__ investigating the systemmatic 'quill brushing' of women from early European history.

Click the book covers to see a zoomed in image and (unaffiliated) links to Amazon for those who like to buy their books there.
