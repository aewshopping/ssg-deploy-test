I was pleasantly surprised by the selection of history books over August 2022: expecting a summer holiday month lull, there are actually quite a few good 'uns, as you can see from the covers below.

For instance:

- ___A History of Water: Being an Account of a Murder, an Epic and Two Visions of Global History___, a historical travelogue of two 16th century portugese eccentrics - Europeans making an attempt to understand the rest of the world.
- ___Dancing on Bones: History and Power in China, Russia and North Korea___, about autocratic government attempts to control their countries history in order to exert power in the present.
- ___A Murderous Midsummer: The Western Rising of 1549___, I don't know anything about this Cornish rebellion and it would be fascinating to learn more (could it happen again?). 
- ___Breakspear: The English Pope___, because - I was surprised to discover - it is written by the ex-boss of a firm I used to work for and I am curious about how he has spent his retirement!
