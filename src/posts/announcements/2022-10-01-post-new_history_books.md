Thirteen new history books identified this month. No doubt they are all good but to pick out a few:

- Olando Figes does his bit to enlighten us all with his __The Story of Russia__. As I had noted earlier this year in my review of [Russia as Empire, by Kees Boterbloem](https://popularhistorybooks.com/posts/reviews/2022-04-08-review-russia_as_empire/), there are not many recently published books in this area so this is a welcome addition.

- In preparation for __black history month__: there are two books published on black people in British society, in the Georgian era and the Victorian era respectively. Plus another book with a similar theme looking at African and Caribbean people in the UK, as far back as we can trace.

- __Mortal Monarchs: 1000 Years of Royal Deaths__, which focusses on the endings of the Kings and Queens of England since Edward the Confessor in the 11th Century (but not including the most recent) and has a literally killer opening sentence.

- __Personality and Power: Builders and Destroyers of Modern Europe__, by Ian Kershaw which will no doubt generate some healthy debate.

- __Index of Prohibited Books: Four Centuries of Struggle Over Word and Image for the Greater Glory of God__ which looks interesting but it was difficult to find out much about it as there is no Amazon 'look inside' option shown, just a hardback version. But given that this list was only officially retired by the Vatican in the 1960s it sounds intriguing.
