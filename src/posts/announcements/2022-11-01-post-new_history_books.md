Ten new history books for this month, with the following going on my virtual TBR pile:

- __Tudor England: A History__ by Lucy Wooding - because lots of people seem to be really into the Tudors whereas I'm never quite sure what the fuss is all about. I am thinking this one might let me in on the secret.

- __The Mongol Storm: Making and Breaking Empires in the Medieval Near East__ by Nicholas Morton - the Mongols were obviously massively important in this hugely important area of the world (the centre of Eurasian civilisation one could argue) but they often seem peripheral characters in other national histories. I'm hoping that this book will provide more focus.

- __The Last Days of the Ottoman Empire__ by Ryan Gingeras - because I have a strong interest in Turkish and Ottoman history but always feel that I never quite know enough!
