Fewer history books published in December but some fascinating titles amongst them - more thoughts on this below the cover pictures.

I think that there are a higher percentage of “would like to read” books than for any other month I can remember. Hopefully the percentage I actually read of the “would like to read” list will be respectable! Some in particular:

- __Weavers, Scribes, and Kings: A New History of the Ancient Near East__ by Amanda H. Podany - this looks like a fascinating and ambitious attempt to make the emergence and development of “civilisation” over thousands of years relatable on a human scale.
- __Enslaved: The Sunken History of the Transatlantic Slave Trade__ by Sean Kingsley and Simcha Jacobovici - looking at the tangible evidence of the slave trade through the authors' exploration of underwater sites.
- __The Vanishing Past: Making the Case for the Future of History__ by Trilby Kent - looking at the evidence of ahistorical attitudes in our societies and putting the case for (I think) continuing support for academic history.
- __Armada: The Spanish Enterprise and Englands Deliverance In 1588__ by Colin Martin and Geoffrey Parker - for some light historical escapism 😉
