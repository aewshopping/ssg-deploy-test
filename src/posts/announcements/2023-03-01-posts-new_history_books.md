A smaller range of new history books this month, perhaps the fewest since my records began![^1] Not that there will be time to read them all anyway of course...

Here are a few that caught my attention:

- ___The Prince and the Plunder: How Britain took one small boy and hundreds of treasures from Ethiopia___ _by Andrew Heavens_ - This is the first popular history book covering Ethiopia that I have seen since I started keeping track.[^2] It tells the story of how the six-year-old Prince of Ethiopia Alamayu was taken to England by the British at the end of the 19th Century as a 'guest' (i.e. hostage) following their invasion of the country.
- ___Untied Kingdom: A Global History of the End of Britain___ _by Stuart Ward_ - I'm interested in this one partly because I haven't read much contemporary history recently, and it is a subject that I am pretty ignorant of.
- ___Women and the Crusades___ _by Helen J. Nicholson_ - this looks like an in-depth and expert survey of a perennially popular topic - and should shed light from a slightly different angle.
- ___The Dress Diary of Mrs Anne Sykes: Secrets from a Victorian Woman’s Wardrobe___ _by Kate Strasdin_ - covering the fascinating 'fabric diary' of a well-travelled 19th Century British lady. It looks like a great way into the wider world at that time but also into the more intimate life of the diarist.
