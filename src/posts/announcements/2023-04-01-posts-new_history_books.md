A nice bunch of books this month. There seems to be a theme of _ideas_, with titles on Patriarchy, the West, Religion and Science, and a Northern Renaissance. Plus at least one dead-cert best-seller in _The Earth Transformed_ by Peter Frankopan.

The ones on my personal wishlist are:

- ___The Earth Transformed: An Untold History___, _by Peter Frankopan_ - this book seems to have gone down well so I am keen to read it too! A bit of a brick, but forgiven because it is covering the entirety of human history, Frankopan is tracing the natural environment's impact on human history. I'm interested to see how he steers a middle path between blindingly obvious (blown up by a volcano) and blatantly obscure (for want of a shoe...).

- ___UPROAR!: Scandal, Satire and Printmakers in Georgian London___, _by Alice Loxton_ - quite a lot of my modern history degree focused on the late 18th Century UK, and I was always drawn to the jokes and the satire so I'm very keen to see what Alice Loxton has to offer.

- ___Great Kingdoms of Africa___, _edited by John Parker_ - I have mentioned before that history books covering African countries are not published that often in the UK. This one looks like it is a general overview of some iconic kingdoms spread across the African continent. It should be a great place to start!

- ___Courting India: England, Mughal India and the Origins of Empire___, _by Nandini Das_ - I got sent a copy of this one by mistake, so this is on the to-read pile as well 🙂. It looks like it is focussing on the moment when the then relatively inconsequential European country of Britain first came into contact with the all powerful Mughal empire.
