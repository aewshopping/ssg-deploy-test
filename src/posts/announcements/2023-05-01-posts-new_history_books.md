It's mostly European history this month, plus a couple of grand narratives with collapse and microbial doom as a theme...

This month I will be mostly reading:[^1]

- ___Amongst the Ruins: Why Civilizations Collapse and Communities Disappear___, _by John Darlington_ - I was (am) a big fan of Jared Diamond's efforts on this front so am keen to see how JD#2's work compares.

- ___Beyond the Wall: A History of East Germany 1949-1990___, _Katja Hoyer_ - aside from [the film Goodbye Lenin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Bye,_Lenin!) I have very little knowledge of East Berlin and this book looks likes a great place to start.

- ___Women of Ancient Rome: To Survive Under the Patriarchy___, _Lynda Telford_ - because how _do_ you survive?

- ___Revolutionary Spring: Fighting for a New World 1848-1849___, _Christopher Clark_ - looks like a fascinating blow by blow account of this transitory revolutionary moment, plus I love how the cover makes it feel like it could have happened just yesterday.
