So what have we got? It's a pretty good haul this month, centered around Europe mostly but with travel around the world as a bit of a motif...

The ones that I particularly like the look of are:

- ___Hawkhurst: Murder, Money and Smuggling in Georgian England___, _by Joseph Dragovich_ - I have already read this one (review coming soon) and enjoyed the dramatic (and at times terrible) account of tea 18th Century English tea smugglers.

- ___The World of Sugar: How the Sweet Stuff Transformed Our Politics, Health, and Environment Over 2,000 Years___, _Ulbe Bosma_ - because I would like to put all those fantastically profitable and horrifically inhumane New World sugar plantations into context.

- ___The Wager___, _David Grann_ - this one seems like it has been around for ages already as I have seen positive reviews all over the place. A tale of a shipwreck and mutiny, beautifully recounted, so we are told.

- ___Around the World in 80 Pots: The Story of Humanity Told Through Beautiful Ceramics___, _Ashmolean Museum_ - pots in museums used to make me run for the nearest cafe but I have come to appreciate why they are such an amazing record even if they do look a bit dull. This coffee table style book is not a history of pots, but instead the story of a number of the more glamorous ones from the Ashmolean collection, which spans thousands of years and much of the world.
