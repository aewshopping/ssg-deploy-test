It was a bit more of a struggle to find history books this month, partly because less were published in general and also because the Amazon books Advanced Search seems to have partially broken, so I couldn't rely on it as much as I normally do. Nevertheless I tracked down nine that looked interesting!

A few that stand out to me:

- ___Korea: A New History of South and North___, _by Victor Cha, Ramon Pacheco Pardo_ - not sure if anything is wrong with the old history or not but this looks like a great (and eye-catching) book on a fascinating subject.

- ___Ancient Africa: A Global History, to 300 CE___, _by Christopher Ehret_ - I'm always trying to bone up on history from the continent of Africa and this one goes back further than most...

- ___Memory Makers: The Politics of the Past in Putin's Russia___, _by Jade McGlynn_ - I'm not totally sure if this is history or not but it is certainly historiography and certainly looks worth reading. I'm always interested in how different countries approach history and this one looks at the contemporary Russian approach, where the past appears to be as rigourously policed as the present.
