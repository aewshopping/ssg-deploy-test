A great selection in July 2023 with a surprisingly large number of books on ancient history - 6 out of the 12 published. (A quick google reveals that there is no such thing as Ancient History Month!)

A few that I particularly like the look of:

- ___Life and Afterlife in Ancient China___, _by Jessica Rawson_ - written by the warden of my old university college so I am curious to have a look... it seems to be something like a cultural history of ancient China in 12 burials.

- ___Pax: War and Peace in Rome's Golden Age___, _by Tom Holland_ - I've enjoyed a couple of Tom Holland's other books and I'm sure this one will be a good read too.

- ___The Age of Atlantic Revolution: The Fall and Rise of a Connected World___, _by Patrick Griffin_ - I had a quick look at the sample on Amazon: the intro looked fascinating and well written, with the book covering revolutions in late 18th century / early 19th century North America, France, Ireland and South America.
