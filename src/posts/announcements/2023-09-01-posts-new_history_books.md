So here they are, the 14 history books published in August that I could track down and that met my criteria for inclusion! A nice range of different subjects are covered, albeit most of them have a European perspective.

Here are a few that stuck out for me:

- ___Backbone of the Nation: Mining Communities and the Great Strike of 1984-85___, _by Robert Gildea_ - last month I came across a book published by the ex-warden of my ex-University college. This month it is an ex-history tutor of the ex-college, with this interesting looking book on the history of the miners strike in the UK.

- ___Empires of the Steppes: The Nomadic Tribes Who Shaped Civilisation___, _by Kenneth W. Harl_ - I enjoy the open road myself so this one instinctively appeals to me.

- ___Belisarius & Antonina: Love and War in the Age of Justinian___, _by David Alan Parnell_ - because I am a sucker for a gold mosaic, and am always keen to fill in the missing pieces when it comes to Byzantine history.
