Not so many history books in December, I guess because most of the publishing was done in November or earlier to meet Christmas demand... but quantity is no guide to quality of course, and there is still more than most normal people can read in a month!

A couple that particularly caught my eye were:

- ___From Genghis Khan to Tamerlane: The Reawakening of Mongol Asia___, _by Peter Jackson_ - having cycled through Uzbekistan I would be keen to learn more about why Tamerlane mattered beyond simply killing lots of people.

- ___A Republic of Scoundrels: The Schemers, Intriguers, and Adventurers Who Created a New American Nation___, _by David Head and Timothy Hemmis_ - I'm sure this book will get up some people's nose but I appreciate any effort to make people of the past more human even if that means a close look at the warts!
