A couple that caught my eye were:

- ___Empireworld: How British Imperialism Has Shaped the Globe___, _by Sathnam Sanghera_ - after having recently read _One Fine Day_ I'm more conscious of how pervasive the British Empire was until very recently, so am keen to check this one out too.

- ___Judgement at Tokyo: World War II on Trial and the Making of Modern Asia___, _by Gary J Bass_ - focussing on the arguments made at the war trials of the Japanese top brass, I'm interested to find out how the author links this to Asia nowadays.
