14 new history books in the metaphorical bag from Feb 2024. For some reason this month has proven to be quite a global mix, which I like!

A few that I would like to dig into are:

- ___Revolusi: Indonesia and the Birth of the Modern World___, _by David Van Reybrouck_. I had no idea that Indonesia was the first of the colonial countries to establish it's independence after world war 2, and would love to find out more.

- ___To The City: Life and Death Along the Ancient Walls of Istanbul___, _by Alexander Christie-Miller_. Is this a history book? I don't know but it seems to include a blend of modern and medieval history. And Istanbul is such a fascinating place I think it would be hard to write a bad book about it.

- ___A History of the World in Twelve Shipwrecks___, _by David Gibbins_. I'm curious to see if the history of the world looks different from the bottom of the ocean.
