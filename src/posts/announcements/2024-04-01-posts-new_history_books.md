March always seems to be a slower month for history books for some reason that I can't entirely fathom, but there's enough to be getting on with! I've shared a few notes below on a few that I would like to read.

A few that I would like to dig into are:

- ___The Language Puzzle: How We Talked Our Way Out of the Stone Age___, _by Steven Mithen_. As the author of one my all time favourite books (After the Ice) I'm favouribly desposed to anything by Steven Mithen. The title is a bit provocative, so it will be interesting to have a deeper look.

- ___Money and Promises: Seven Deals That Changed the World___, _by Paolo Zannoni_. Perhaps not one to excite most people but as I work in this sort of area it hits the spot for me! Seems to be based on the early modern + late modern development of finance and whatnot in Europe.

- ___Writing on the Wall: Graffiti, Rebellion and the Making of Eighteenth-Century Britain___, _by Madeleine Pelling_. A nice counterpoint to Gibbon and Austen: what did ordinary 18th century folk want to write / rant about?
