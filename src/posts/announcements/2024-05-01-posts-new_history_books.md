A few more on the shelf this month compared to last, with a couple that may even qualify for blockbuster history book status, if you are an E Cline or a Z Badawi fan...

A few that I like the look of are:

- ___After 1177 B.C.: The Survival of Civilizations___, _by Eric Cline_. The prequel to this one (called _1177 The Year that Civlisation Collapsed_) achieved something of cult status among ancient history books, so it will be interesting to see how Cline follows it up.

- ___The Carnation Revolution: The Day Portugal's Dictatorship Fell___, _by Alex Fernandes_. Another one of those books that makes you think 'I really should know more about...'. In this case it is the end of the Portugese fascist regime exactly 50 years ago on 24 April 1974.

- ___Britain's Slavery Debt: Reparations Now!___, _by Michael Banner_. This book is making a current moral-political argument about the history of Britain's participation in the slave trade. I would like to read the case for in this book and see if / to what extent I agree.

- ___Arise, England: Six Kings and the Making of the English State___, _by Caroline Burt_. I should also mention this one which I am currently reading with a review coming soonish!
