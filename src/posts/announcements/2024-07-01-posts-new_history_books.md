Nearly all of the 12 popular history books (published in the UK) I found from June 2024 are focussed on Europe, except for a near miss with a history of Jersulem, and a work on history and human biology. But within this geographical boundary there is fair amount of variety - I've picked out some specific examples below the cover images...

A few that I have my eye on:

- ___How the West Became Antisemitic: Jews and the Formation of Europe, 800â€“1500___, _by Ivan G. Marcus_. This one looks a bit more 'scholarly' than your typical popular history book, but the topic is one that I would like to know about, on the assumption that the origin point of antisemitism was not inherent in the origin Christianity itself

- ___Spycraft: Tricks and Tools of the Dangerous Trade from Elizabeth I to the Restoration___, _by Nadine Akkerman, Pete Langman_. With the dual purpose of finding out what was done back then and also which of the more benign tricks might still be useful today ðŸ™‚. 

- ___Sexed: A History of British Feminism___, _Susanna Rustin_. Going from the 18th century to the present day on this, my assumption is that this will be well written and engaging.
