I'm off on holiday for a couple of weeks now so posting this round-up a few days before month end - but don't worry I will add on any July history book stragglers into the August post!

With that said, it's an attractive looking set of ten books covering a wide range of subjects: from Elizabethan spies, Mughal royalty, and Crusading delinquents... a few more notes on the books that I was most intrigued by below.

A few that I have my eye on:

- ___Crusader Criminals: The Knights Who Went Rogue in the Holy Land___, _by Steve Tibble_. At first glance I thought this was one of those auto-generated books that flood the Amazon catalogue and give themselves away by their cookie-cut covers. At second glance I realised this was an interesting new take on the crusader story focusing on the idea that the crusades were from one perspective (i.e. the receiving end) a swarm of violent bigoted young men decamping to the Eastern Mediterranean. 

- ___The History of Ideas: Equality, Justice and Revolution___, _by David Runciman_. Runciman is a big hitter in the academic and literary world, with plenty of experience explaining stuff to students and the public, so this book should be decent!

- ___Empire's Son, Empire's Orphan: The Fantastical Lives of Ikbal and Idries Shah___, _Nile Green_. This book has already attracted some ire in its Amazon reviews so clearly people still care a lot about the subject and the people involved. Recounting the tale of two people who (I think) had roots in Afghanistan, and who may or may not have hoodwinked a lot of people in the West.
