A good line up this month - I'm always happy to see geographical and temporal spread in the selection!

For the first time since I have been keeping track there is a popular history book on the history of Iraq which is great to see. Also Big Hitter Richard J Evans has published a book on Nazi Germany. Alongside this we have two books on medieval manuscripts, a book on nobodies and mangos.

I've highlighted a few more books below the covers that I hope to read soon.

Those that I will be reading, or intending to read:

- ___The Greatest Nobodies of History: Minor Characters from Major Moments___, by _Adrian Bliss_. I like the concept of this one, which hopefully should be entertaining in a semi-serious sort of way.

- ___Tracks on the Ocean: A History of Trailblazing, Maps and Maritime Travel___, by _Sara Caputo_. Definitely serious, this book looks at how drawing lines on maps came to define and create reality in the modern world. At least that what I think it is about. I have a copy on my shelf so will find out for sure soon.

- ___Flint Tools Field Guide: Identifying Stone Age Tools___, by _Robert Turner_. You could argue that this isn't _really_ a popular history book, but I saw it and liked it so decided to stick it in. I also ordered a copy and am hoping to use it to help me find a prehistoric flint this weekend... I will report back.

- ___To Catch a Spy: How the Spycatcher Affair Brought MI5 in from the Cold___, by _Tim Tate_. I tend to read less contemporary history these days, but this one will be an exception. The title is very Carre-esque - we will see if real life is just as bleak.
