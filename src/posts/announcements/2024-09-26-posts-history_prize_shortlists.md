History book prizes divide opinion - how can you ever fairly decide on a 'best' book? What does best even mean? And how come my book didn't win?

Personally I like them. Even trying to keep tabs on [all new books](https://popularhistorybooks.com/allbooks/) as I do, the prize shortlists always throw up a bunch I have missed, which I am confident will meet a minimum level of quality.

_The purpose of this post is to share these history books with you, the reader._

The two big names in history book prize world are the [Wolfson History Prize](https://www.wolfsonhistoryprize.org.uk/) and the [Cundhill History Prize](https://www.cundillprize.com/). Both prize organisations have just released their shortlists for 2024. Both look like very good lists!

### Cundhill History Prize shortlist for 2024

The Cundhill prize panel are looking for "_the book that embodies historical scholarship, originality, literary quality and broad appeal._"

For the record my guess is the three finalists will be Revolusi, Gun Control and Judgement At Tokyo.

If you want to be a winner bear of the Wolfson prize, bear in mind that "_books are judged on the extent to which they are carefully researched, well-written and accessible to the non-specialist reader._" Oh yes, you also have to be resident in the UK during the year of publication.

_Out of the Darkness_ as the winner?

The only book that is in both lists is _Shadows At Noon: The South Asian Twentieth Century_ by Joya Chatterji.

Across both lists I have only read (and reviewed) [Courting India: England, Mughal India and the Origins of Empire](https://pophist-ssg-test.glitch.me/posts/reviews/2023-07-14-review-courting-india/) which I thought was a fantastic book.
