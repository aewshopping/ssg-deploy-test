A great list this month, possibly the largest number of high quality history books published in a single month since my records began! (in 2019)

There are four in particular that I'm looking out for, detailed below.

My highlights for this month are:

- ___The Golden Road: How Ancient India Transformed the World___, by _William Dalrymple_. We don't get that many 'Indian centric' history books published in the UK so it is great to see a book like this, written by one of the aristocrats of the popular history world.

- ___Henry V: The Astonishing Rise of England's Greatest Warrior King___, by _Dan Jones_. I've enjoyed Dan Jones' previous books and have recently listened to a (dare I say it) 'tour de force' of the life of Henry V from The Rest is History podcast, so I'm confident that this book will be a good one!

- ___Money: A Story of Humanity___, by _David McWilliams_. I have a professional interest in money but even without this the vibes are that this is a readable, thoughtful and even enjoyable book.

- ___The Invention of Good and Evil: A World History of Morality___, by _Hanno Sauer_. When did the Times first start A Changing? 5 million years ago with our chimp like ancestors apparently. This one is on my shelf already and I am looking forward to reading it!
