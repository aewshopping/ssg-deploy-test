I identified a mere nine history books published in the UK in November 2024 (excluding the hundreds of highly dubious titles with AI slop covers). 

Of the nine there is one I will be putting on my xmas wishlist and another that is already on the popularhistorybooks bookshelf...

My personal highlights for this month are:

- ___Patria: Lost Countries of South America___, by _Laurence Blair_. Having travelled the region a little while ago, but still with only a fairly hazy idea of what has happened since the fall of the Incas and today, I am keen to have a look at this book.

- ___The Crowd in the Early Middle Ages___, by _Shane Bobrycki_. A high brow take on a low brow subject? This one is already on the shelf of my co-reviewer Andy Salisbury. He is a slow reader but hopefully in a few months we will have his verdict!
