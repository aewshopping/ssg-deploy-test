It's the first post of the new year 2025 and unlike every other website on the internet I am going to start with a damp squib rather than a bang. Hopefully we will build to a crescendo over the coming months and experience a few bone-dry rockets along the way...

But after searching the web for history books published in the UK in December 2025 I have ended up with just 6 that seem suitable. Here they are, hopefully you will find one or two that you like! My highlights are below.

My highlights for this month are:

- ___The Last Stand of the Raven Clan: A Story of Imperial Ambition, Native Resistance and How the Tlingit-Russian War Shaped a Continent___, by _Gerald Easter, Mara Vorhees_. This book takes us back to a time when the Russian empire under Peter the Great was expanding accross the top of Asia and into the North American continent with the intention of colonising the pacific coast as far down as California. The Tlingit peoples in southeast Alaska stopped them in their tracks. Sounds like a brilliant and under-told story.

- ___A Short History of the World in 50 Failures___, by _Ben Gazur_. For a bit of light hearted reading alongside the new year self help books!
