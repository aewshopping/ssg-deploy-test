I spotted 14 new history books in the wild last month (in the UK, in hardback). I always like to see a diversity of topics and periods, and this batch has a good range, from the ancient Mediterranean to modern India, with stop-overs in Malta, Nazi Germany, and 19th Century Africa along the way...

The three that I would most like to read are:

- ___The Great Siege of Malta___, _by Marcus Bull_. Telling the story of the famous 16th century siege, we are promised the Ottoman perspective. I'm off on holiday there later this year so I will try to read this before I go. 

- ___Gods, Guns and Missionaries: The Making of the Modern Hindu Identity___, by _Manu Pillai_. Linking the activities of Western Missionaries from the 16th century with the development of modern Hinduism, which reacted against but also borrowed from the Christian evangelists.

- ___The Grammar of Angels: A Search for the Sublime and the Magical Power of Language___, by _Edward Wilson-Lee_. The opening line of the blurb is _'Does there exist a form of speech so powerful as to allow the speaker to control the listener, taking over their thoughts and even their will?'_ As a sci-fi fan (as well as a popular history afficionado) I love this sort of stuff!
