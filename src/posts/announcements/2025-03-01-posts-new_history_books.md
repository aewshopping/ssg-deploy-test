Some attractive looking books published in February 2025 (UK, Hardback), with a unusually high proportion focussed on ancient history, and in particular Mesopotamian history. I love all this stuff, as it is right on the edge of my knowledge zone - and it's intriguing in its own right. These three for example look great:

- __Between Two Rivers: Ancient Mesopotamia and the Birth of History__, _by Moudhy Al-Rashid_. Exploring the concept of discovering the lives of 'regular' people through chance preservations in records or imprints on clay.

- __The Library of Ancient Wisdom: Mesopotamia and the Making of History__, _by Selena Wisnom_. Covering the library of the Assyrian King Ashurbanipal (7th century BCE), with books / tablets we can still check out today ðŸ™‚.

- __The Far Edges of the Known World: A New History of the Ancient Past__, _by Owen Rees_. Global in scope, Rees reminds us that the Ancient World did not only consist of Romans and Greeks, it was a much more interesting place!
