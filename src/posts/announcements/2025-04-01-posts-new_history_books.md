A round up of the new popular history books published in March in the UK (hardback, reasonably priced). A fairly disparate set of which I am investigating:

- __The Golden Throne: The Rule of Suleyman the Magnificent__, _by Christopher de Bellaigue_. The second in what I think is a trilogy, I thoroughly enjoyed ([and reviewed](https://popularhistorybooks.com/posts/reviews/2022-04-29-review-the_lion_house/)) the first one. If it is more of the same that can only be a good thing!

- __The Celts: A Modern History__, _by Ian Stewart_. This book is a history of the history of the Celts - how their modern identity coalesced in the 18th and 19th centuries to become the venerated ancestors that we know today. I have made a start on this already and will be reviewing it soon (I hope!).

- __Drax of Drax Hall: How One British Family Got Rich (and Stayed Rich) from Sugar and Slavery__, _by Paul Lashmar_. Telling the family history of the Drax family who became wealthy pioneering the slave plantation system on Barbados in the 17th Century - and remain wealthy and influential in the UK today. I read a positive review of the book on the Guardian website and feel it is something I would like to get to grips with.
