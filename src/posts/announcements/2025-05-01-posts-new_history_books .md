Here are the history books published (in hardback) in the UK last month. They were a little harder to track down this month, with only nine on the list. 

The two that I have my eye on are:

- __Mythica: The Untold History of the Real Women Behind Homer's Myths__, _by Emily Hauser_. I tend to be suspicious of so called 'untold histories' but I would like to hear more about this one! Presumably the story is not a very happy one?
- __America, AmÃ©rica: A New History of the New World__, _by Greg Grandin_. I like histories that break out of national boundaries, and provide a broader view. Contextualising USA as an emerging nation (I presume?) is also an interesting perspective!
