New history books from last month in the UK, published in hardback. Something for everyone this time: witches, WW1, orchids, death and tequila!

A couple that I have my eye on are:

- __When We Ruled: The Rise and Fall of Twelve African Queens and Warriors__, _by Paula Akpan_. I'm always on the lookout for accessible histories of African countries, kingdoms or regions, given that there are relatively few blockbuster African histories published in the UK. This one is definitely looks worth a look. 
- __Tequila Wars: JosÃ© Cuervo and the Bloody Struggle for the Spirit of Mexico__, _by Ted Genoways_. Having been to the Jose Cuervo tequila factory[^1] in Mexico without giving the man himself a second thought, I'm intrigued to learn a bit more.

[^1]: The Jose Cuervo tequila factory tour was a fun experience and recommended. I also remember an enormous mango tree in the square outside the factory with a bench underneath on which were seated a handful of old men passing the time of day. The mangos were large and ripe, and every now and then they would fall to the ground with a massive thump. The old men were completely unfazed even though I think a direct hit would have been fatal.
