The latest monthly roundup: new history books published in June in the UK (hardback). A bit less politics and a bit more in the way of _ideas_ this month... 

A couple that I have my eye on are:

- __Shattered Lands: Five Partitions and the Making of Modern Asia__, by _Sam Dalrymple_. Taking a broader view of Britain's Indian empire, which seems to have extended to the middle east as well. I'm keen to find out how countries like Oman, Yemen and Bahrain fit into the story of _The Partition_ which has always centred on the subcontinent.
- __An Accidental History of Tudor England: From Daily Life to Sudden Death__, by _Steven Gunn_. Something a bit more light hearted: ordinary people dying longer ago - with the details of their death bringing the Tudor period to life. This was written (co-written?) by an old tutor of mine so I should both acknowledge this conflict of interest and insist it will be excellent!
