After my self awarded summer break I am a little late this month, but better late than never. An unusually high proportion dealing with the subject of slavery, coming at it from a few different angles.

Here are three in particular that I would like to find out more about:

- __Captives and Companions: A History of Slavery and the Slave Trade in the Islamic World__, by _Justin Marozzi_. I'm about two thirds of the way through this already and it is excellent. A far-ranging, even-handed history covering often little known stories.

- __The Heretic of Cacheu: Struggles Over Life in a Seventeenth-Century West African Port__, by _Toby Green_. This seems to be a micro-history centred on one woman accused of witchcraft in what is now Guinea-Bissau. It looks fascinating.

- __Sanctuary: Ways of Telling, Ways of Dwelling__, by _Marina Warner_. I'm not sure if this will be a tour de force, or an over engineered political statement - hopefully the former!
