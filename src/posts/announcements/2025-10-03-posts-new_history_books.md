A focus on the history of Britain this month with half of the books peering back at the history of this island, and more precisely the English bit of it. The rest of the world is not totally neglected though, for example with a timely book on the US Constitution which I am glad to see is still a thing.

The three books from this month that I woud set either myself or my time-rich virtual doppleganger to read are:

- __The First King of England: Ã†thelstan and the Birth of a Kingdom__, by _David Woodman_. I've always been a fan of the Anglo-Saxon kings without ever knowing much about them - I'm sure distance makes the heart grow fonder! This one should reduce the gap.

- __The Finest Hotel in Kabul: A People's History of Afghanistan__, by _Lyse Doucet_. Has the feel of a 'journalist's history book', but that said I think using the hotel as a way to bring together all sorts of people is a compelling way to tell the story of the (presumably) recent past in Afghanistan.

- __A Scandal in KÃ¶nigsberg__, by _Christopher Clark_. And finally one which I have actually read and so can reliably comment on! A short sweet and superb book, using the story of an actually-not-that-turbulent priest to illuminate a zeitpunkt.[^1] [My review of Scandal in Konigsberg.](https://popularhistorybooks.com/posts/reviews/2025-09-26-review-scandal-in-konigsberg/)

[^1]: The English language doesn't seem to have good word to convey the concept of 'a particular place at a particular time' - in this case mid 19th Century Konigsberg. On the assumption that if AI is good at anything it should be good at this, I used google Gemini to isolate the German word zeitpunkt as the best candidate for a loanword. I will check with my sister who is an ex German translator (thanks in part to AI...) as to the appropriateness of this word and report back!
