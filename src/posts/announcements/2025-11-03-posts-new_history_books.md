I didn't manage to grub up so many new history books from last month, but as ever there is more than enough to keep you reading! The three books I particularly liked the look of are:

- __Rhyme and Reason: A Short History of British Poetry__, by _Mark Forsyth_. I am a big fan of history of course. I am also a big fan of poetry, even though I never actually read any (except the ones on the London underground). Anyway this book looks like a great way to kill two birds with one stone.

- __The Zorg: A Tale of Greed and Murder That Inspired the Abolition of Slavery__, by _Siddharth Kara_. I have heard of this horrific case many times but have never read about it in any detail, this looks like the opportunity to do just that.

- __Slow Poison: Idi Amin, Yoweri Museveni, and the Making of the Ugandan State__, by _Mahmood Mamdani_. The first history book I have added to the database on Uganda. I suspect the story told here will not be a happy one unfortunately.

Reporting back from last month on the lack of word in the English language to convey the concept of 'a particular place at a particular time': I had thought that __'zeitpunkt'__ would be a good bet not least because it sounded quite cool. However my ex-German-translator sister tells me that this doesn't really carry any association with a point in _space_ (just time), so that doesn't work so well. I am now leaning towards the word __'topochron'__ to do the job. I coined this word with the help of a conversation with google gemini, after rejecting chronotope as a word already in circulation.
