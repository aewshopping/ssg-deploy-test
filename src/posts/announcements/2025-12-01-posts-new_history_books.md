A slightly smaller selection of new history books from November 2025 (in the UK, in hardback) - nevertheless they are all welcome! The three I am looking out for are:

- __Mexico: A 500-Year History__, by _Paul Gillingham_. Big thick national history books are always a bit of a gamble, but given that Mexico has such an interesting history this one may be worth it!

- __El Generalísimo: Franco: Power, Violence and the Quest for Greatness__, by _Giles Tremlett_. A key figure in modern European history but not someone I know much about, Franco (and the Franco period) is someone (something) I would like to understand better.

- __On Pedantry: A Cultural History of the Know-it-All__, by _Arnoud S. Q. Visser_. The flipside of wisdom: I would hope for plenty of amusing anecdotes!
