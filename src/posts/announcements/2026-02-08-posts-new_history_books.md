I have combined January and Decemeber to give myself a break over xmas. However it turns out that there was not much out in December anyway and a much greater number in January so it worked out well. A few that caught my eye are:

- __Exit Stalin: The Soviet Union As a Civilization, 1953-1991__, by _Mark B. Smith_. Charting the attempt to fulfill the promise of socialism, this looks like a balanced and insightful account.

- __First Kings: Forged by Vikings in England and Norway__, by _R. A. J. Waddingham_. The second history book written by my now retired ex-boss: I watch his progress with considerable interest. Is it any good? I hope so!

- __Surviving Rome: The Economic Lives of the Ninety Percent__, by _Kim Bowes_. I'm always curious about the Roman have-nots, and the have-not-muches - what was life really like?

- __Becoming Arab: The Formation of Arab Identity in the Medieval Middle East__, by _Yossef Rapoport_. This book addresses a question I have never really been able to get a handle on - what does it mean to be Arab and when did people switch over from what it was they indentified as previously?
