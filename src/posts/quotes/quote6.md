meta_excerpt: A quote from a history book we have reviewed
---
>>  I said to myself “This king would be worth 30 dinars in Oman in the [slave] marketplace, and the seven [companions] 160 dinars, and they have clothes worth 20 dinars, so that would bring us at least 3,000 dirhams without any risk attached.” 📣
